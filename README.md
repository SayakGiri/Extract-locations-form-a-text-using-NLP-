People, places, and things—nouns—play a crucial role in language, conveying the sentence’s subject and often its object. Due to their importance, it’s often useful when processing text to try to identify nouns and use them in applications. This is known as either entity identification or named-entity recognition (NER).    Entity Recognition is used in almost all application of NLP. As an example, suppose you have a list of reviews on mobile phones. Using NLP, you can extract different entities like company name, mobile phone model, price, place etc.
